👨‍🎓 I recently graduated from National University of Singapore, where I majored in Economics

💻 I previously interned in product-related roles at companies such as **Grab** and **Jane Street**

😎 I enjoy diving deep into problems, speaking to customers and stakeholders, and finding solutions together with designers, engineers, and all parts of the business

⚡ As a soon-to-be Product Manager in 2024, I'm excited to kickstart my career in the field and learn all about what it takes to launch impactful and valuable products!

This website will ideally be used for:
* A short glimpse into who I am, professionally and outside of work
* A place for me to post my thoughts on work, career, personal reflections, etc.
* And perhaps a portfolio of sorts, if I can figure out what that really means for a PM

For more detailed information about my professional experience, feel free to contact me (sidebar email) for my resume!
