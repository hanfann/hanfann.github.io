👨‍🎓 I recently graduated from National University of Singapore, where I majored in Economics

💻 I previously interned in product-related roles at companies such as **Grab** and **Jane Street**

😎 I enjoy diving deep into problems, speaking to customers, and finding solutions together with designers, engineers, and all stakeholders

⚡ As a soon-to-be Product Manager in 2024, I'm excited to kickstart my career in the field and learn all about what it takes to launch impactful and valuable products!

🤞 Outside of work, I enjoy exploring coffee spots, brewing my own filter coffee, reading (tech, product, and some fiction), running, watching football, and backpacking!
