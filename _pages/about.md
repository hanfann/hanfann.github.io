👨‍🎓 I recently graduated from the National University of Singapore, where I majored in Economics

💻 I previously interned in product-related roles at tech/tech-oriented companies such as **Grab** and **Jane Street**

🧠 As a soon-to-be Product Manager in 2024, I'm excited to kickstart my career in the field and learn all about what it takes to launch impactful and valuable products! 

## What this website is

* Something for me to fill my time before I commence full time employment
* Content for me to fill up my name domain
* As you can tell, this website is pretty pointless at the moment
  * Potential plans: a place for me to post my approach to product case questions, post my thoughts on anything including work, career, and personal reflections

### What this website is not

* A detailed overview of my professional experience
* A substitute for my resume
